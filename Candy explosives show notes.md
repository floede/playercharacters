### Highlights:
Candy got her love for games from her dad, who was kind enough to get her a PlayStation for Christmas. But obviously he had to try it out for himself first.

That started a life long love for video games, so it was only natural to get a degree in computer games design.

That lead to her first job in software testing, but she found that she would rather be playing games than making them. 

And then when the PlayStation 4 arrived with the share button right there on the controller, she just had to try streaming.

In this episode we discuss how Rainbow Six Siege went from a bit of a niche game, to a massive success.
Candy mention how her brief experience with the Destiny community was an incredibly positive experience, and how streamers in general are very welcoming and willing to help other streamers.
